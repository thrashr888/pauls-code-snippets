This is just my personal repo for code snippets.

It's setup as an Eclipse PHP Project, hence those hidden files at the top.

These functions were mostly written by me for a current project
but I also have compiled some stuff from other devs and open source repos.

You'll find mostly PHP here but I also keep Ant tasks, JS and notes here.

== qDB Class ==

A very minimal DB abstraction class. It just wraps PHP's mysql functions.

== Symfony Classes ==

These are taken out of working projects. Sorry, documentation is sparse for now.

== build.xml ==

I've setup a couple of Ant tasks in here to manage Git.

 - git-add
 - git-commit
 - git-pull
 - git-push
 - git-status
